Section 5: Polish & Finishing Touches

This section introduces the final polish to make Pong feel complete:
- Audio integration (paddle hits, wall bounces, scoring, background music).
- Helper text displayed mid-game for modifier keys.
- Live value readouts showing CPU speed, Player speed, and Ball speed.
- Win condition (first to 3) and results screen with winner message.
- Quick navigation: press [1] anytime to return to the Menu.

Press 1 to switch to the Menu state.
Press 2 to start the Game state.
Press SPACE to launch the ball once the game has begun.
Use keys [3â€“8] to adjust CPU, Player, and Ball speeds in real-time.
