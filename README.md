# PongTutorial
Learn 2D game development fundamentals through Pong - the first step in our tutorial series.

## About
This tutorial introduces the fundamentals of 2D game development, including working with rectangles, objects, configuration, collisions, and more.  

Each section provides multiple approaches to common problems. For example, when exploring state management, we’ll compare three methods:  
- **Integrated State (Main Loop)**  
- **Game Class State Manager**  
- **PolarisKit Scene System**  

The main tutorial uses **PolarisKit** - a Python game framework built in-house by PolarisStudios - which powers all of our upcoming 2D titles. However, every concept is shown with alternatives, so you can follow along whether or not you use PolarisKit.

## Series Overview
This series is divided into 5 parts, each building on the last and introducing new concepts and design decisions.

### Section 1 – Initial Setup & State Management
- [Integrated State (main_integrated.py)](Section1_Setup/main_integrated.py)
- [Game Class State Manager (main_gameclass.py)](Section1_Setup/main_gameclass.py)

Covers installation, first-time setup, and creating a Pygame window.  
Introduces three approaches to state management:
- Integrated State (Main Loop)  
- Game Class State Manager  
- PolarisKit Scene System  

*The third approach, PolarisKit Scene System, is demonstrated in a separate repo and video series.*

| Approach                  | Pros                     | Cons                 |
|---------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------|
| Integrated (Main Loop)    | Simple, all in one place | Hard to maintain     |
| Game Class State Manager  | Organized, scalable      | More boilerplate     |
| PolarisKit Scene System   | Professional structure   | Advanced setup       |

PolarisKit’s Scene System builds on the same principles as the Game Class approach, but adds a professional layer for managing multiple scenes, transitions, and larger projects.

State management is the backbone of many games, starting simple and growing from here will give you strong fundamentals to build upon.

Next, in Section 2, we’ll add the Ball class and introduce physics and collisions. This is a important topic to cover, as we will learn about rectangles, positioning and collisions.

While this may feel like a slow start, having these basics down, and understanding the why and the how, will prove to be incredibly valuable down the road.
Mastering these basics now will make advanced features feel natural later.

## 📘 Section 1 – Overview & Key Takeaways  

By the end of Section 1, you should:  
- ✅ Understand how to set up a Pygame project and open a game window.  
- ✅ Know what *state management* means and why it’s critical in any game.  
- ✅ Be able to implement three approaches to state management:  
  - **Integrated (Main Loop):** Simple but unscalable.  
  - **Game Class State Manager:** Organized and expandable.  
  - **PolarisKit Scene System:** Professional-level structure (covered in repo/video).  
- ✅ Recognize the pros/cons of each approach and when to use them.  
- ✅ See how responsibilities shift from the main loop into a dedicated `Game` class.  
- ✅ Learn why fonts and rendering logic belong inside the `Game` class, not main.  
- ✅ Explore examples of “incorrect” vs “cleaner” methods, and understand why design choices matter.  

### 🎯 Why This Matters  
State management is the **backbone** of every game you’ll build. Mastering it early makes physics, collisions, UI, and multi-scene systems feel natural later.  

> **Up Next – Section 2:**  
We’ll add the Ball class and dive into **physics and collisions**: rectangles, positioning, and collision detection.

### Section 2 – Pong Ball Setup & Physics
- [ball.py](Section2_Ball/ball.py)
- [game.py](Section2_Ball/game.py)
- [main.py](Section2_Ball/main.py)

Introduces the **Ball** class, demonstrating basic physics and collision handling.  
The ball moves automatically, bounces off window edges, and can be reset to the center.  
Press **SPACE** to start the ball once in the game state.
Press **R** to reset the ball to the center  


| Approach                | Pros                                | Cons                                           |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Basic Collision         | Easy to understand, quick to set up | Limited gameplay depth (no paddles or scoring) |
| Hardcoded Positioning   | Simple, requires little setup       | Not scalable to different screen sizes         |
| Reset Mechanic          | Allows control during testing       | Manual trigger, not automated by gameplay yet  |


## 📘 Section 2 - Overview & Key Takeaways  

By the end of Section 2, you should:  
- ✅ Understand how to set up an object and initialize parameters.  
- ✅ Know what a rectangle is, and how to position it
- ✅ Recognize the pros/cons of each approach and when to use them.  
- ✅ See how movement across the X and Y axis works.  

### 🎯 Why This Matters  
Understanding rectangles, collisions and objects within this scope allows you to expand to other game genres seamlessly and without extra effort. 

> **Up Next – Section 3:**  
We’ll add the Player and Opponent classes as paddles to interact with the ball, and dive into **movement and collisions**: rectangles, positioning, and collision detection, to transform movement into gameplay.

---

### Section 3 – Paddle Setup (Player & CPU)
- [ball.py](Section3_Paddles/ball.py)
- [player.py](Section3_Paddles/player.py)
- [opponent.py](Section3_Paddles/opponent.py)
- [game.py](Section3_Paddles/game.py)
- [main.py](Section3_Paddles/main.py)

Adds both **player-controlled** and **CPU-controlled** paddles.  
- Player paddle: moves with **W/S** or **Up/Down** keys, constrained within the screen.  
- Opponent paddle: simple AI that mirrors the ball’s vertical position.  
- Ball now collides with paddles and resets when leaving the screen.  

| Approach              | Pros                                   | Cons                                          |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Player Paddle Control | Clear input mapping, easy to test      | Limited to human reflexes, no CPU fallback    |
| Opponent AI (Perfect) | Simple to implement, always responsive | Unrealistic, cannot be beaten, no difficulty  |
| Boundary Constraints  | Prevents objects leaving the screen    | Gameplay feels rigid                          |

## 📘 Section 3 - Overview & Key Takeaways  

By the end of Section 3, you should:  
- ✅ Understand how to set up a player-controlled paddle using keyboard input.  
- ✅ Understand how to move an object automatically with basic AI logic.  
- ✅ Recognize the pros/cons of paddle control approaches (player vs CPU).  
- ✅ See how `colliderect` works to detect paddle–ball collisions.  

### 🎯 Why This Matters  
Introducing paddles transforms movement into **interaction**. The ball is no longer bouncing in isolation, but engaging with the player and opponent. This is the first step toward real gameplay, setting the stage for scoring, difficulty scaling, and strategy.  

> **Up Next – Section 4:**  
We’ll add scoring through left/right boundary detection, and trigger automatic resets on the Ball class when a point is scored. This introduces the foundation of the **gameplay loop**.

---

### Section 4 – Scoring & Full Game Loop
Builds on Section 3 by adding a scoring system and displaying points for both player and opponent.  
- Scores increase when the ball goes past the left or right edge.  
- Player and opponent scores are displayed at the top of the screen.  
- The game loop now feels complete, with continuous play and visible score tracking.  

- [ball.py](Section4_Scoring/ball.py)  
- [player.py](Section4_Scoring/player.py)  
- [opponent.py](Section4_Scoring/opponent.py)  
- [game.py](Section4_Scoring/game.py)  
- [main.py](Section4_Scoring/main.py)  

| Approach              | Pros                                   | Cons                                      |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Basic Scoring         | Easy to implement and understand       | No win/loss condition, play never ends    |
| Hardcoded Positions   | Simple and quick to set up             | Not scalable to different resolutions     |
| Continuous Game Loop  | Provides a real sense of gameplay flow | Can feel repetitive without difficulty AI |

## 📘 Section 4 - Overview & Key Takeaways  

By the end of Section 4, you should:  
- ✅ Understand how to implement a scoring system.  
- ✅ Know how to track and display player and opponent points.  
- ✅ Recognize the pros/cons of a basic loop vs a full gameplay system.  
- ✅ See how scoring connects all previous systems into a complete loop.  

### 🎯 Why This Matters  
Adding scoring transforms a set of mechanics into a **game**. The ball, paddles, and collisions now feed into a visible score system, creating stakes and competition. This introduces the core concept of a **gameplay loop** — action, feedback, reset, repeat.  

> **Up Next – Section 5:**  
We’ll refine gameplay by introducing polish and difficulty scaling, making gameplay more dynamic and challenging. This is where balance and fun really come into play.

### Section 5 – Polish & Finishing Touches
Adds audio, UI helpers, and finishing details to make Pong feel complete.  
- Sound effects: paddle hits, wall bounces, scoring, and background music.  
- Helper text displayed mid-game for modifier keys.  
- Live value readouts showing current CPU speed, Player speed, and Ball speed.  
- Win condition (first to 3) and a results screen with a winner message.  
- Quick navigation: press **[1]** anytime to return to the Menu.

- [opponent.py](Section5_Polish/opponent.py)  
- [game.py](Section5_Polish/game.py)  
- [main.py](Section5_Polish/main.py)  

| Approach                  | Pros                                        | Cons                                     |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Audio Integration         | Adds immersion and feedback                 | Requires correct asset setup             |
| Modifier Controls         | Great for testing and debugging             | Not typical in finished games            |
| Win Condition + Results   | Provides closure and replayability          | Still a basic condition (first to 3 only)|
| UI & Helper Text          | Improves clarity for players                | Can clutter screen if overused           |

## 📘 Section 5 - Overview & Key Takeaways  

By the end of Section 5, you should:  
- ✅ Know how to integrate sound effects and background music into Pygame.  
- ✅ Be able to add win/loss conditions to complete a game loop.  
- ✅ Understand how to create helper UI for both gameplay and debugging.  
- ✅ Recognize how polish (UI, audio, feedback) transforms a demo into a complete experience.  

### 🎯 Why This Matters  
Polish is what separates a **prototype** from a **finished game**.  
Sound, UI, and clear win/loss conditions provide feedback loops that keep players engaged and make the game feel satisfying.

## 🔮 What’s Next?

If this series does well, we’ll expand beyond Section 5 and explore even more ways to grow from Pong into larger projects.

- **Section 6 – Menus & Flow**  
  Building full menus, options screens, and scene transitions — leading naturally into PolarisKit’s Scene System.  

- **Section 7 – Expanding Mechanics**  
  Adding new gameplay elements like power-ups, speed modifiers, and multiple balls.  

- **Section 8 – Project Structure & Packaging**  
  Organizing assets, cleaning up project structure, and preparing builds for distribution.  

And beyond Pong, we can branch into **classic arcade-inspired projects**:  
- Breakout  
- Space Invaders  
- Flappy Bird  
- Other small but iconic games that teach new mechanics and patterns.  

The goal: keep scaling your skills from **small, focused games** into **larger projects** with PolarisKit at the core.
