# PongTutorial
Learn 2D game development fundamentals through Pong - the first step in our tutorial series.

## About
This tutorial introduces the fundamentals of 2D game development, including working with rectangles, objects, configuration, collisions, and more.  

Each section provides multiple approaches to common problems. For example, when exploring state management, weâ€™ll compare three methods:  
- **Integrated State (Main Loop)**  
- **Game Class State Manager**  
- **PolarisKit Scene System**  

The main tutorial uses **PolarisKit** - a Python game framework built in-house by PolarisStudios - which powers all of our upcoming 2D titles. However, every concept is shown with alternatives, so you can follow along whether or not you use PolarisKit.

## Series Overview
This series is divided into 5 parts, with each part building on the last and introducing new concepts, solutions, and design decisions.

### Section 1 â€“ Initial Setup & State Management
Covers installation, first-time setup, and creating a Pygame window.  
Introduces three approaches to state management:
- Integrated State (Main Loop)  
- Game Class State Manager  
- PolarisKit Scene System  

### Section 2 â€“ Pong Ball Setup & Physics
Implements the Ball class, demonstrates ball physics, and introduces collision handling.  
By the end of this section, the ball will bounce infinitely across the window edges.

### Section 3 â€“ Paddle Setup (Player & CPU)
Builds player-controlled and CPU-controlled paddles.  
Includes movement, boundary constraints, two-player mode, and basic CPU paddle logic.

### Section 4 â€“ Scoring & Full Game Loop
Implements a scoring system and detection logic to determine round outcomes.  
Completes the full game loop with conditions for ending and restarting games.

### Section 5 â€“ Polish & Finishing Touches
Adds audio, sound effects, and visual improvements to give the game a more complete feel.
